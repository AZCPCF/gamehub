### **Tips for Execution**
1. **Dedicated Time**: Spend **3-4 hours/day** consistently.  
2. **Project Deployment**: Deploy mini-projects and final projects on platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify** to showcase your skills.  
3. **Documentation**: Follow official documentation for tools like Redux Toolkit, Zod, GSAP, and React Query.  
4. **Iterate and Expand**: Expand mini-projects by adding features as you learn.
